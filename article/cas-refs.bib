 abstract = {Job testing technologies enable firms to rely less on human judgement when making hiring decisions. Placing more weight on test scores may improve hiring decisions by reducing the influence of human bias or mistakes but may also lead firms to forgo the potentially valuable private information of their managers. We study the introduction of job testing across 15 firms employing low-skilled service sector workers. When faced with similar applicant pools, we find that managers who appear to hire against test recommendations end up with worse average hires. This suggests that managers often overrule test recommendations because they are biased or mistaken, not only because they have superior private information.},

This paper presents several strategies based on vectorial and probabilistic models to solve the problem of profiling applications according to a specific job offer. Our objective is a system capable of reproducing the judgement of the recruitment consultant. We have evaluated a range of measures of similarity to rank candidatures by using ROC curves.

    abstract = {Inside the clustering problem of categorical data resides the challenge of choosing the most adequate similarity measure. The existing literature presents several similarity measures, starting from the ones based on simple matching up to the most complex ones based on Entropy. The following issue, therefore, is raised: is there a similarity measure containing characteristics which offer more stability and also provides satisfactory results in databases involving categorical variables? To answer this, this work compared nine different similarity measures using the TaxMap clustering mechanism, and in order to evaluate the clustering, four quality measures were considered: NCC, Entropy, Compactness and Silhouette Index. Tests were performed in 15 different databases containing categorical data extracted from public repositories of distinct sizes and contexts. Analyzing the results from the tests, and by means of a pairwise ranking, it was observed that the coefficient of Gower, the simplest similarity measure presented in this work, obtained the best performance overall. It was considered the ideal measure since it provided satisfactory results for the databases considered.}

 abstract = {The possibilities of calculating similarity based on ordinal characters are evaluated by distinguishing subtypes of the ordinal scale. Multivariate analysis is most problematic when ordinal variables appear together with other scale types in the data. This difficulty is solved by extending Gower's general coefficient of similarity to ordinal data types, facilitating cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. Two alternatives, a non-metric and a metric version, are offered. The modified formula implies that ordinal variables are equally weighted with the others, and that partially and fully ranked data are both applicable, due to the inherent standardisation procedure. A morphological data set derived for the moss genus Tortula illustrates the new approach.},

 abstract = {By both random and nonrandom assignments of numbers to rank orders (which are consistent with the monotonic nature of the categories), it is shown that ordinal variables can be treated as if they conform to interval scales. The scoring systems, of which 18 were randomly generated by a computer, resulted in negligible error when comparing any assigned scoring system with any selected "true" scoring system. Errors are determined by the Pearsonian correlation coefficient (r) and r^2. The advantages of treating ordinal variables as interval are demonstrated with regard to the relation between occupational prestige and suicide. These advantages include: (1) the use of more powerful, sensitive, better developed and interpretable statistics with known sampling error, (2) the retention of more knowledge about the characteristics of the data, and (3) greater versatility in statistical manipulation (e.g., partial and multiple correlation and regression, analysis of variance and covariance, and most pictorial presentations). The computer approach to this problem does not exhaust all possibilities for assigning numbers, which partially limits the generality of the findings.},
